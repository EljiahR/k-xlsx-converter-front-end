# K-XLSX Converter Front-End

Welcome to the **K-XLSX Converter Front-End**! This project was built to simplify the process of parsing and cleaning up weekly schedules extracted from Excel files. Specifically designed to meet the needs of my current job, this tool transforms raw Excel data into a more usable, printable format. It's not a generic Excel converter ‚Äì it‚Äôs tailored for a very specific purpose to help organize, manage, and make sense of complex weekly schedule data quickly and efficiently.

## üí° What Is It?

The **K-XLSX Converter Front-End** is a web application that takes Excel (.xlsx) files containing weekly schedule data, parses them, and outputs them in a more organized and clean format. The goal is to make it easier to work with these schedules, especially when they're messy or unstructured in Excel. This project is designed for use in a specific work environment and may not be applicable for random or unrelated Excel sheets.

The recent addition of **Redux** improves the app‚Äôs ability to manage large datasets and handle more complex workflows, giving you a smoother experience with improved performance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Excel Parsing for Schedules**: Tailored to handle weekly schedule data, this tool processes Excel files and restructures them into a cleaner, easier-to-read format.
- **Schedule Optimization**: After parsing, the app cleans up and organizes the data, making it better suited for printing and further manipulation.
- **Efficient Data Management with Redux**: Redux has been integrated for efficient state management. This improves the responsiveness of the app, especially when dealing with larger Excel files.
- **File Upload**: Standard file input allows users to easily upload Excel files for conversion.
- **Download Cleaned Files**: Once your schedule is parsed and cleaned, you can download the newly formatted file, ready to be printed or shared.
  
## üîß Technologies Used

- **React** ‚Äì For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux** ‚Äì Recently added to handle state more efficiently, enabling better performance and scalability.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** ‚Äì Powers the app‚Äôs logic, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **XLSX Library** ‚Äì Used to parse Excel files and extract relevant schedule data.
- **Axios** ‚Äì For making API requests to communicate between the front-end and the backend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Update: Redux Integration

In the latest update, **Redux** was integrated into the project to better manage the state, especially when working with larger Excel files. This improves performance, making it more scalable and able to handle complex datasets with ease. It ensures smooth interaction and a responsive interface when parsing and transforming the schedule data.

## üöÄ Why This Project?

This tool was built specifically for my current work needs, where weekly schedule data often comes in messy and unstructured Excel formats. Converting this data into something readable, organized, and easy to work with is essential. The **K-XLSX Converter Front-End** streamlines this process, allowing me to quickly clean up and format the schedules in a way that‚Äôs optimized for printing and sharing.

Since it‚Äôs tailored for a specific work-related task, it‚Äôs not a general-purpose tool for any random Excel files. However, it‚Äôs been indispensable for my job, and I hope the idea behind it resonates with others who face similar data cleanup challenges.

## üèóÔ∏è What's Next?

This project is always evolving, and future updates will focus on:

- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Implementing drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads to make the user experience even smoother.
- **Advanced Schedule Parsing**: Adding more features to better handle different structures or new data formats that may arise in the future.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Improving error messages and adding validation to make the tool even more robust.
